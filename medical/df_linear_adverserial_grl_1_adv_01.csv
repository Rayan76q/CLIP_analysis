Her serum blood sugar was recently found to be normal. My exam revealed a mild latent hyperopia (Without cycloplegia: +0.75 manifest, with +0.50 by automated testing; Post cycloplegia). Additionally, the tear break up time is definitely abnormal, showing often poor tear coverage immediately after a blink OU. She has noticed that blinking can improve her vision at times, and therefore it is likely that ocular surface problems account for some component of her visual symptoms. I also found mild latent hyperopia, which at her age should not be causing symptoms. But, she works at a computer often 10 hours per day, which suggests that reduced capacity for adequate accomodation at near may be contributing to her problems. I am doubtful that this will be very helpful, but it is worth a trial. A question of high intracranial pressure was raised by her craniosacral specialist. I find no evidence to support that concern. IMPRESSION: 1. Latent hyperopia, OU, mild 2. Abnormal tear break up time OU Recommendations: 1. Try +0.75 glasses for near work 2. Fundus photographs/OCT 3.
